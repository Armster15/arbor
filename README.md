# ðŸŒ³ Arbor

Arbor is a native music player for Apple devices. I built this to easily pitch-shift, adjust speed, and add reverb on the go.

Arbor's core app is built in Swift, while also shipping an embedded version of Python. This allows us to use battle-tested libraries like [yt-dlp](https://github.com/yt-dlp/yt-dlp) directly on device.
